# 🔊 Echo – Preserve Memories with AI

Echo is a human-centered AI application that allows you to recreate and interact with digital personas of loved ones using voice, chat, and video. Built entirely with **Bolt.new**, Echo blends lifelike avatars (via Tavus), natural speech (via ElevenLabs), and memory-based AI conversation for an emotionally resonant experience.


## ✨ Features

- 🧬 **Upload Memories** – Photos, audio, text stories
- 🧠 **AI Personality Engine** – Fine-tuned LLM captures tone, style, and emotional memory
- 🎭 **Lifelike Avatar (Tavus)** – Generates realistic video of loved ones speaking
- 🔊 **Voice Cloning (ElevenLabs)** – Reproduces speech from audio samples
- 💬 **Conversational Chat** – Chat with your Echo in real time
- 📞 **Video Call Mode** – Simulated video calls with emotional responsiveness
- ⏳ **Time Capsule Messages** – Send messages from the future (birthdays, anniversaries)



## 💡 Inspiration

“My grandmother passed away two years ago. I kept wondering—what if I could just call her again? That idea sparked **Echo**. It’s not just about remembering someone. It’s about talking to them—again.”
